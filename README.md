Core Concept:
Virtual Study Buddy: The main character is a virtual pet (maybe a cat, dog, or even a more abstract pet) that needs your help to thrive. The pet has different "needs" (similar to a Tamagotchi), and completing study goals directly impacts its well-being.

Study Goals: Users will set goals (e.g., study for an hour, complete a chapter, etc.), and when these goals are met, the virtual pet gets "rewarded" by getting healthier, more energetic, or happier.

Gamification: Add levels, achievements, and rewards for staying consistent, completing goals, and "caring" for the pet.
